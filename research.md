## PhD. thesis
I am currently working on my dissertation (i.e. PhD. thesis) at the [Faculty of Informatics and Information Technologies](http://www.fiit.stuba.sk/en.html?page_id=749), Slovak University of Technology in Bratislava. My supervisor is associate professor [Mária Lucká](https://scholar.google.sk/citations?user=1bQwDSgAAAAJ&hl=sk&oi=ao). The theme of the thesis is about improving forecasting accuracy of electricity load by cluster analysis of consumers (or prosumers). I am focusing on three interesting areas of data mining:

  * **Time series analysis**
  * **Clustering**
  * **Forecasting and regression**

The area of **time series analysis** consists of a research in (and also proposals of new) **representations** of time series, specifically efficient dimensionality reduction of time series of electricity consumption that will input to a clustering algorithm.

The **clustering** task is about classification (clustering) consumers into more predictable (forecastable) groups of consumers. The challenge is to develop an algorithm that will be adaptable to a behavior of **multiple data streams** of electricity load. Results of clustering are then used in time series analysis and regression methods to improve forecasting accuracy of aggregate (global) or individual (end-consumer) electricity load. Results of clustering can be also used for smart grid monitoring and an extraction of typical patterns of electricity consumption.

The research scope of the **forecasting and regression** part focuses on methods that will benefit the most from clustering of consumers. Forecasting and regression methods have to incorporate to a model a seasonality and a trend, and they have to be adaptable to a concept drift appearance. Here is a promising approach – **ensemble learning** that combines multiple forecasts from various forecasting and regression methods.
